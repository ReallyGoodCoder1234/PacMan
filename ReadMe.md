This is the Sir Codealot version of the common, classic old school arcade game, Pacman. 
How I used Sir Codealot in my project is by making him the robot, adding him to the home 
screen page and putting him there whenever you died. There is a very obvious cutscene, 
this is to show you what the win screen looks like. In the video, I show you the credits, 
how to play screen, the game over screen, the homepage and the win screen. The code is in the 
linked github repository.
